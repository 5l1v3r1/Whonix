## Whonix /etc/whonix_firewall.d/10_default

## Instead of directly editing this file,
## you are advised to create a file /etc/whonix_firewall.d/20_user.
## This is because when Whonix gets updated,
## /etc/whonix_firewall.d/10_default will get overwritten and possibly get new
## new default values and comments. The whole folder /etc/whonix_firewall.d/
## gets sourced in lexical order, which means, anything set in
## /etc/whonix_firewall.d/20_user will always overrule the following defaults,
## so you can keep your settings even after updating Whonix.

## There is a second, extra firewall for Whonix-Workstation.
## Experts should read the design notes in
## /usr/local/bin/whonix_firewall
## and make an informed decision.
## It is disabled by default.
WORKSTATION_FIREWALL=0

## End of Whonix /etc/whonix_firewall.d/10_default
