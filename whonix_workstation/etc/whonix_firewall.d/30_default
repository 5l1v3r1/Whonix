## Whonix /etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default

## Instead of directly editing this file,
## the user is advised to create the file /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.
## This is because when Whonix gets updated,
## /etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default will be overwritten and may receive new
## new default values and comments. The entire folder /etc/whonix_firewall.d/
## is sourced in lexical order, which means anything set in
## /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user will always override the following defaults.
## The user may keep their settings even after updating Whonix.

## There is a second, extra firewall for Whonix-Workstation.
## Experts should read the design notes in
## /usr/bin/whonix_firewall
## and make an informed decision.
## It is disabled by default.
WORKSTATION_FIREWALL=0

## End of Whonix /etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default
