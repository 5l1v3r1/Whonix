## Whonix /etc/whonix.d/30_desktop_default

## Instead of directly editing this file,
## the user is advised to create the file /etc/whonix.d/50_desktop_user
## This is because when Whonix gets updated,
## /etc/whonix.d/30_desktop_default will be overwritten and may receive new
## new default values and comments. The entire folder /etc/whonix.d/
## is sourced in lexical order, which means anything set in
## /etc/whonix.d/50_desktop_user will always override the following defaults.
## The user may keep their settings even after updating Whonix.

## This file is responsible for configuring /etc/profile.d/80_desktop.sh,
## which is a script, which decides based on these settings, whether to
## autostart the login manager (graphical desktop environment) or not.

## If set to 1, this feature is enabled.
## Otherwise, it will be completely disabled.
## When not enabled, it might make sense to run
## "sudo update-rc.d kdm defaults" to re-enable autostart of kdm,
## if that is your display manager.
whonixdesktop_autostart_decision_feature=1

## If set to 1, it will start the display manager,
## if there is enough total RAM (configurable below).
whonixdesktop_start_display_manager=1

## Which display manager /etc/profile.d/20_desktop.sh should
## start using "sudo /usr/sbin/service "$whonixdesktop_display_manager" start".
whonixdesktop_display_manager=kdm

## Minimum amount of total RAM, which has to be available
## to start the display manager. If less RAM is
## available, no display manager will be autostarted.
whonixdesktop_minium_ram=500

## When set to 1, the check for enough total RAM
## will be disabled.
whonixdesktop_skip_ram_test=0

## If set to 0, wait a configurable (below)
## amount of seconds, before starting the
## display manager. During this perioid you
## can press "ctrl + c" to abort starting
## the display manager.
whonixdesktop_wait=1

## If whonixdesktop_wait is set to 1,
## wait the following amount of seconds,
## before starting the display manager.
whonixdesktop_wait_seconds=10

## Set to 1 to enable debugging.
whonixdesktop_debug=0

## Disable update-rc.d $dm remove in display-manager-dpkg-post-invoke:
## kdm, gdm, lightdm, slim, wdm, xdm, nodm.
## Only set to 1 if you know what you are doing.
whonixdesktop_disable_rc_d_remove=0

## End of Whonix /etc/whonix.d/30_desktop_default
