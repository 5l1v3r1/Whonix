## Whonix /etc/whonix.d/30_aptrepository_default

## Instead of directly editing this file,
## the user is advised to create the file /etc/whonix.d/50_aptrepository_user
## This is because when Whonix gets updated,
## /etc/whonix.d/30_desktop_default will be overwritten and may receive new
## new default values and comments. The entire folder /etc/whonix.d/
## is sourced in lexical order, which means anything set in
## /etc/whonix.d/50_aptrepository_user will always override the following defaults.
## The user may keep their settings even after updating Whonix.

## This feature is documented on the Whonix Trust page:
##     https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Trust/
## Or see:
##     man whonix_repository

## Uncomment, and leave set to 1, if you distrust Whonix's APT repository and
## want to disable it. Run whonix_repository in case you commented it out.
## Note the hint at the top of this file!
#WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRUST_CONFIG="1"

## Uncomment and set to the version you want to use. Valid values are stable,
## testers and developers. (Or special values if you know what you are doing.)
## Defaults to stable.
#WHONIX_APT_REPOSITORY_DISTRIBUTION_CONFIG="stable"

## End of Whonix /etc/whonix.d/30_aptrepository_default
