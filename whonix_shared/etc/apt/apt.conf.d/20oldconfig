## --force-confold: do not modify the current configuration file,
## the new version is installed with a .dpkg-dist suffix.
## With this option alone, even configuration files that you have
## not modified are left untouched. You need to combine it with
## --force-confdef to let dpkg overwrite configuration files that
## you have not modified.

Dpkg::Options {
   "--force-confold";
