## Whonix /etc/apt/preferences.d/50_banned-packages

## Prevent conflicting software from getting installed, just in case.
##
## Advanced users who know what they are doing are free to comment packages of
## their choice out and therefore make them installable again.

## Additionally the autostart of Tor on Whonix-Workstation has been disabled
## in /etc/default/tor to prevent Tor over Tor and to satisfy the dependencies
## of some packages on Tor, for example for TorChat. See also:
##     https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Dummy_Tor

## NTP does not work over Tor because it uses UDP.
## If it were to work, it would not be secure, because
## it is by default not encrypted. Whonix has its own
## safe network time synchronization mechanism. See
## Whonix design.

## geoclue is not evil in itself. Just having it installed may lead some third

## would not be useful or "phone home".
