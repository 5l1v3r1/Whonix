## Whonix /etc/apt/sources.list

## If you want to see the example which came with the upstream
## distribution, see: /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list

## This is the default sources.list for Whonix, which is derivative
## of Debian Wheezy.

## Because we installed the base Debian Wheezy operating system
## using grml-debootstrap and apt-cacher-ng, /etc/apt/sources.list
## gets manually fixed by Whonix build scripts.
