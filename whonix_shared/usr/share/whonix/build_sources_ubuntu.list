## NOTE:
## There is no support for machines based on Ubuntu by Whonix developers.
## This file only exists, to make Whonix's build environment compatible
## with Travis CI.

## Can't use precise (what Travis CI is using as well), because precise does
## not include python-stem.
#deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main universe
#deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security main universe

## Used saucy, because only saucy contains python-stem.
## Using trusty, because it contains faketime 0.9.5.
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main universe
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-security main universe

## We currently do not need any source packages for building Whonix.
