## zenity --timeout in seconds.
## A day has 86400 seconds. Removes old messages before posting
## new ones in case the user was away for more than one day.
##
## The & at the end of a zenity line ensures, that the
## script will not wait until zenity will be closed.
## It also prevents zenity throwing an error, if zenity is installed,
## but no x server is started. (That is the case on Whonix-Workstation in text mode.)
##
## zenity --display=:0.0 is required to make it compatible with cron
## see http://promberger.info/linux/2009/01/02/running-x-apps-like-zenity-from-crontab-solving-cannot-open-display-problem/
## --no-markup to allow showing "&" see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621907
## WHONIXCHECK_RUN_BY_CRON gets set by user cron
##
## We would prefer a popup free solution. As soon as the timeout bug in
## notify-send is fixed, we switch to notify-send.
## https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/390508
## If we change to notification daemon later, when the timeout bug is fixed,
## we have to ensure notify-send output is compatible with being started by cron.

## check if notify-send is installed
## - that is not the case for CLI Custom-Workstation users
## - that is also not the case on Whonix-Gateway
