## Using a simpler method to install initial packages.
## Leaving dependency resolution to dpkg.
##
## Modifications comment:
## It has a little disadvantage, it may re-install packages, which have been
## uninstalled by advanced users between running chroot-post.d scripts and
## finalizing/importing the image. It should not hinder creation modifications
## of Whonix, because in the cleanup chroot-post.d script, we do not download
## packages (for later re-installation at this point), which are not installed
## at that point.
dpkg --install "/var/lib/whonix/initial-packages/"*

## This may not be necessary.
## Re-running the same command, so we can see in the log, if it runs without
## any warnings the second time.
