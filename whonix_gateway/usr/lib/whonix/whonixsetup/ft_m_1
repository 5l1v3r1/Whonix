Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you connect to. However, by default, it does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from learning that you are using Tor. If this matters to you, you can reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a Tor bridge relay rather than connecting directly to the public Tor network. Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!

(Technically speaking, whonixsetup activates Tor by commenting out "DisableNetwork 1" in /etc/tor/torrc.)

Enable Tor and connect to the public Tor network?

   if [ "$LINE" = '#DisableNetwork 1' ]; then
      service tor reload 
      dialog --title "Success!" --msgbox '"DisableNetwork 1" was already commented out in /etc/tor/torrc.
So Tor should now be activated.

whonixsetup really only activates Tor by commenting out "DisableNetwork 1" in /etc/tor/torrc.
Running it multiple times in a row archives nothing.
In case of network problems, this is probable not the cause.
You can confirm that by manually checking if "DisableNetwork 1" has been out commented in /etc/tor/torrc.
