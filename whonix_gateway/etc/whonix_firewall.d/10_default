## Whonix /etc/whonix_firewall.d/10_default

## Instead of directly editing this file,
## the user is advised to create the file /etc/whonix_firewall.d/20_user.
## This is because when Whonix gets updated,
## /etc/whonix_firewall.d/10_default will be overwritten and may receive new
## new default values and comments. The entire folder /etc/whonix_firewall.d/
## is sourced in lexical order, which means anything set in
## /etc/whonix_firewall.d/20_user will always override the following defaults.
## The user may keep their settings even after updating Whonix.

## Enable (1) or disable (0) transparent TCP proxying for the Whonix-Workstation.

WORKSTATION_TRANSPARENT_TCP=1

## Enable (1) or disable (0) transparent UDP proxying for the Whonix-Workstation.
## This setting has really no effect.
## The Tor network does not support UDP yet.
## This is not a Whonix specific limitation.
## There is a limited workaround for tunneling udp over Tor with Whonix:

## Do not bother changing this setting, it will do nothing.

## Torify Gateway / Hide the fact, that you are a Whonix user ##
################################################################

## For ensuring, that the Whonix-Workstation can only send traffic through Tor,
## it would not be required to route Whonix-Gateways traffic through Tor as well.
## Torifying the Whonix-Gateway prevents your ISP from knowing you are a Whonix user.
##
## This does NOT prevent your ISP from knowing you are a Tor user.
##    If you want this, read:
##    https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Hide%20Tor%20and%20Whonix%20from%20your%20ISP/
##
## Torifying the Gateway has the disadvantage, that apt-get operating system updates
## are slower. It also makes testing, developing and all kinds of special non-stock
## configurations more complicated. You can optionally disable this feature.
##
## Experts only! There is also the user clearnet on the Whonix-Gateway, which
## is allowed to to make non-Tor connections.
##
## Allow (1) or forbid (0) the root user on the Whonix-Gateway to make non-Tor connections.
## Experts only!
ALLOW_GATEWAY_ROOT_USER=0

## This will simply open incoming port 22 in the Whonix-Gateway firewall.
