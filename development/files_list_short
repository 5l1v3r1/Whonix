# Whonix-Gateway

This will be a special case.

/home/user/Whonix/whonix_gateway/etc/tor/torrc

All files in /usr/local/share/whonix/chroot-scripts/* should become postinst files.
(No one expected to edit it.)

# Whonix Shared

This file must be disabled While updating Whonix configuration files, but not while updating package dependencies.

/home/user/Whonix/whonix_shared/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20oldconfig

Not sure about that one. Should not be replaced without asking, since it could break the system.
There is unfortunately no /etc/fstab.d in Debian. For VM users, this file should always be the same,
unless the user adds additional custom devices (second virtual hdd). For bare metal users, it's worse,
if they rely on that file, it could break their system.
